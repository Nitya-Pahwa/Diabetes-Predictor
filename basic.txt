Diabetes Predictor Project

Overview

This project involves building a predictive model to determine if a person has diabetes or not.It analyses the detils of aperson and tells the ouput based on that conditions.

Key Objectives

- Predict diabetes occurrence based on various features related to health and personal data.
- Analyze the relationship between different features and their impact on diabetes prediction.
- Provide a user-friendly solution for diabetes prediction.

Dataset

- Source: A dataset containing health metrics and diabetes status extracted from Kaggle .
- Features: The dataset includes attributes such as:
  - Pregnancies
  - Glucose
  - Blood Pressure
  - Skin Thickness
  - Insulin
  - BMI
  - Diabetes Pedigree Function
  - Age
  - Outcome (target variable: 1 for diabetes, 0 for no diabetes)

Methodology

1. Data Preprocessing:
   
   - Getting basic knowledge of the data.
   - Checking for missing values.
   - Checking for duplicate rows.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

   - Visualize feature distributions using univariate and multivariate analysis.
   - Correlation analysis to identify key predictors of diabetes.
   - Outlier detection and removal.

Modeling:

   - Split data into training and testing sets.
   - Apply scaling techniques StandardScaler for numerical features.
   - Train machine learning models including:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Decision Trees
     - Random Forest Classifier
     - XGBoost Classifier
     - Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
   - Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy_score.

Hyperparameter Tuning:

   - Used Optuna for hyperparameter optimization to improve model performance.

Prediction and Validation:

   - Test the model on unseen data.
   - Compare predicted outcomes with actual outcomes.

Libraries and Tools Used

- Python: Programming language for implementation.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: For numerical computations.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
